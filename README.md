## Summer 2016 Full-Time Cohort

Welcome! I can't wait to get started with our boot camp.

This repository will be updated as we progress through the 12 weeks. For now, you should probably check out the [Prework](week0/prework.md). You may also want to take a look at the [Syllabus](week0/syllabus.md).

If you need to contact me, I'm `@james` on the [WeCanCodeItBootcamp](https://wecancodeitbootcamp.slack.com) Slack team, or you can email me at <mailto:james@wecancodeit.org>.
