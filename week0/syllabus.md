# Daily breakdown

Every day will start with check-in at 9:30am and check-out at 3:00pm.

Monday-Thursday mornings of the first nine weeks will generally consist of guided learning in the morning (kind of like lecture, but way more interactive), and lab time in the afternoon. During lab time, you will be working on homework assignments with the rest of your cohort, with access to instructors.

Fridays will be project days, with the entire day devoted to working on projects.

During the last three weeks, the schedule will change to accommodate working on final projects, which will be group-based.

# Grading Policy

Class is from 9:30am-3:15pm Monday-Friday, with the exception of holidays. You are expected to be on campus every day for the entire time except an hour break for lunch from 12pm-1pm. Some days there will be career-focused guest lectures during the lunch hour, which you will be told about ahead of time so you may bring a lunch.

If you attend less than 90% of classes, you will need to make up the time in some other way. The TA will have more information for you if that's the case.

In order to pass the course, you must receive a grade of 70% or higher averaged over all the assignments. You must also complete every assignment - any assignments considered **incomplete** must be resubmitted before the end of the course.
