# Prework

## Set Up GitHub

1. Create a free personal GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join
1. Set a profile picture and fill out some of your personal info, including your location

## Keep Us In The Loop

1. Fill out the shared Google sheet with your contact info and GitHub username. Make sure to put the email address you would prefer us to use to contact you. Please note that we'll be using this for a number of things throughout the cohort.

## Set Up Slack

1. After you fill out the account info form, we'll send you an invitation to our Slack team. When you receive the invitation, set up your account and set a profile picture.

   Never used Slack before? No problem! We'll go over its usage once the cohort begins.

## Prepare Your Mind

1. Take the [Interactive Quiz](http://www.londonacademyofit.co.uk/learning-blog/learning/interactive-quiz-fixed-vs-growth-mindset/) on Fixed vs Growth Mindsets. Answer as honestly as possible - don't worry, we aren't going to see the results of this!

1. Fill out this Google Form with your thoughts/reactions. There are no right or wrong answers! <http://goo.gl/forms/FSwKkJKS8I8a7hkr1>

## Set Goal(s)

1. Write down one or two big picture goals that you have for this cohort. What are you trying to get out of it? What do you hope will be different when the boot camp is complete?

1. Think hard on these goals - you will be coming back to them every day as part of check-in!
